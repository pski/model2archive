Model II/12/16 Diagnostics

The official Tandy Radio Shack diagnostics suite for the Model II/12/16.    
This is a working disk and will autoboot to the diagnostics menu.  Run MAIN to get back into test suite from DOS.  
Contains many of the tests found on DIAGNOST.IMD some of which are updated versions.
This is the latest AXX-2037 image available so should be considered the primary diagnostics disk for the Model II/12/16/16B/6000.
