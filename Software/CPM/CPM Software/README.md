I took a serious look at the difficulty in setting up CPM on Model II's and found there to be a lack of complete distributions. I've also found additional useful software from other CPM repositories and placed them here. I wrote TetTRS and the ADM3ON/OFF utility.

ADM3OFF.COM - Turns off ADM3 emulation in P&T CP/M - useful for some games and utlities
ADM3ON.COM - Turns on ADM3 emulation in P&T CP/M - useful for some games and utlities
